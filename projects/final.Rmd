#How it Started

* Professor (Dr. Salinas) reached out to me about doing sports analytics with the baseball team
* Added 3 new people to our group

#Who Does What

* Two of the guys are working on creating 2 apps compatible with IOS and Android. 
* One app will serve as a booking mechanism for pitching data
* The other app will serve as a booking mechanism for hitting data
* Another girl and myself have used R Markdown to produce the statistics that the coaches specifically want.

#How it Works

* Once the data is collected in the app, the coach will hit submit
* The data comes to my email (havenâ€™t figure out if this is exactly how this will work yet.. Trying to get it automated is hopeful outcome)
* The data is loaded into R Studio and is then run through the baseball statistics program.

#How This Class Has Helped

* Data Camp teaching me how to program in R
* What has helped me the most is the DPLYR package and GGPLOT2 package.
