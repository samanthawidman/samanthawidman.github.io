My name is Samantha Widman. I am from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. I previously went to school at Univeristy of North Carolina at Wilmington before transferring to Appalachian State. I moved to the mountains because I no longer saw the beach as a good fit for me. While I still enjoy visiting, I am much happier in the Mountians. I currently study Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics in hopes of obtaining a career as a Data Analyst in the sports industry. Right now, I am working with the baseball team to develop an App that will allow the coaches to log informatino electronically, send it to my email, and I will send back an R markdown report of each player. While I stay busy with school, I also find time to go hiking and soon snowboarding when the winter season arrives.
