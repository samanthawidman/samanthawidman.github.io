My name is Samantha Widman. I am from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. I previously went to school at Univeristy of North Carolina at Wilmington before transferring to Appalachian State. I currently study Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics as a rising senior in hopes of obtaining a career as a Data Analyst. Right now, I am working with the baseball team to develop an App that will allow the coaches to log information electronically, send it to my email, and I will send back an R markdown report of each player. I have had experience in a variety of fields through jobs and internships including Human Resources, Project Development and Management, Sports Analytics, Pharmeceutical Analytics, and more.
