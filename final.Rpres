How it started:
========================================================


- Professor (Dr. Salinas) reached out to me about doing sports analytics with the baseball team
- Added 3 new people to our group

Who does what:
========================================================

- Two of the guys are working on creating 2 apps compatible with IOS and Android. 
- One app will serve as a booking mechanism for pitching data
- The other app will serve as a booking mechanism for hitting data
- Another girl and myself have used R Markdown to produce the statistics that the coaches specifically want. 

How it works: 
========================================================

- Once the data is collected in the app, the coach will hit submit
- The data comes to my email (havenâ€™t figure out if this is exactly how this will work yet.. Trying to get it automated is hopeful outcome)
- The data is loaded into R Studio and is then run through the baseball statistics program.

How this class has helped:
========================================================
- Data Camp teaching me how to program in R
- What has helped me the most is the DPLYR package and GGPLOT2 package.
